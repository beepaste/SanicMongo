MongoMotor is a tiny integration of
[MongoEngine](http://docs.mongoengine.org/en/latest/index.html), a document
object mapper for python and mongodb, with
[motor](http://motor.readthedocs.org/en/stable/), a async driver to mongodb
built using tornado's mainloop.

Using MongoMotor you can define your document as you already do with
MongoEngine, use all querying niceties that you already know and do all db
operations asynchronously using motor.
